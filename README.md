## Background

We’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, we decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## What is Being Created

We’ll combine our new AWS skills with our existing Python superpowers to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

---

## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
